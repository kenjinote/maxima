Maxima 5.45-post change log
===========================

New items in core:
------------------

New items in share:
-------------------
 * new additional package quantum_computing: a simulator of quantum computing
   circuits.

Changes in core:
----------------
 * new code to commute conjugate of derivative (Commit [565fcf])
 * new function gnuplot_send (Commit [54380c])
 * plot2d, plot3d, mandelbrot and julia now use gnuplot_pipes by default
   in all operating systems and in all cases (plot shown on the screen or
   saved to a graphics file). No temporary files are used.
 * new plot option window. It can be used to send the plot to a window
   different from the default 0 window.

Changes in share:
-----------------
 * draw: Restored the detfault gnuplot_pipes format (Commit [a54f2f])
 * draw: Restores the window, font and size options for defaut
   terminal (Commit [096f0b])

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update SBCL, wxMaxima, TCL/TK.
   A newer Gnuplot version is available, but causes problems when using
   pipes on Windows, therefore that was not updated.
 * Use the HTML manual (not the PDF version) in the start menu.
 * Strip included C programs (saves some space).
