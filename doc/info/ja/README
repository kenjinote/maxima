You need a few works around when you make Japanese htmls.
And I don't succeed to treat Japanese characters on  texi2dvi, so I haven't had pdf file yet.

a. works around
1. install gsed.
On Mac OS (Snow leopard), /usr/bin/sed doesn't treat Japanese characters correctly, so I used gsed 4.2.1 in extract_categories.sh.
2. install texi2html 5.0.
texi2html 1.76, which is a version appended in Maxima, doesn't treat Japanese characters correctly, too, so I used texi2html 5.0 (/opt/local/bin/texi2html) in extract_categories.sh.
