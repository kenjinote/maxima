   Thanks to Dieter Kaiser for most of this text


   Backwards-incompatible changes:

 * removed package jtroot3 (superseded by bfallroots)

 * internal symbols of specint replaced by more descriptive names:

    %f         --> hypergeometric
    %e         --> elliptic_ec
    %kelliptic --> elliptic_kc
    %p[a,b,c]  --> jacobi_p
    %p[a,b]    --> assoc_legendre_p
    %p[a]      --> legendre_p
    %q[a,b]    --> assoc_legendre_q
    %q[a]      --> legendre_q
    hstruve    --> struve_h
    lstruve    --> struve_l
    %d         --> parabolic_cylinder_d
    %m         --> whittaker_m
    %w         --> whittaker_w
    %ei        --> expintegral_ei
    %h[n,x]    --> hankel_1 and hankel_2
    %he        --> hermite


   New items in core:

 * general mechanism for functions to distribute over operators
   (distribute_over declaration)


   Other revisions:

 * improved Laplace transforms of special functions

 * assume database:

   The inferences between the declarations of variables as integer,
   real, complex, .. have been cut out. The constant %i is declared
   to be imaginary. The constants %pi, %e, %gamma, %phi are declared
   to be real.
  
   The database handles expressions with constants more completely.
   Facts like assume(x < %pi/2) are now handled correctly.
  
   The sign of sums of constant expressions is determined more
   correctly.
  
   Askinteger take into account more facts from the database.

 * improvements of special functions:

   More functionality for the Hankel 1 and 2 functions:
   Expansion for a half integral order has been implemented.

   More consistent numerical evaluation of Bessel and Hankel functions.

   More general integrals for Bessel functions and implementation of
   integrals for the Airy functions.

   Gamma function accepts a Taylor expansion as an argument.

   Implementation of Struve H and L functions:
   Numerical evaluation for real and complex numbers in float and
   bigfloat precision. Handling of specific values. Derivatives of the
   functions and expansion for a half integral order is implemented.

   Adding mirror symmetry for the Airy functions.

   Improving the limits of the log and factorial functions.

 * package fft: revised for greater speed
 * package to_poly_solver: improvements
 * regularize error and warning messages, and translate via gettext (ongoing)
 * bug fixes and other improvements in plotting code
 * bug fixes in translator
