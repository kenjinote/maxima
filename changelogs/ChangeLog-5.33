   Maxima 5.33 change log


   New items in share:

 * package alt-display: hook for nonstandard display functions
 * package kovacicODE: Kovacic method for ordinary differential equations
 * package odes: several methods for ordinary differential equations
 * package trigtools: manipulating trigonometric function expressions
 * package sound: functions for audio synthesis


   Changes in core:

 * promote result to bigfloat on floating point overflow
 * variables declared to be irrational are considered real
 * display floats with leading "0." instead of "." only
 * function tex: accepts Lisp objects now
 * functions expintegral_shi, expintegral_chi: limits
 * functions hankel_1, hankel_2: numerically evaluate when the order is complex
 * function declare: rational and irrational properties mutually exclusive
 * functions get, put: when first argument is a string, assume it is the name of an operator
 * functions round, truncate: handle arguments of zeroa and zerob
 * functions for Galois fields: improve power tables and introduce nth root
 * operator @: TeX property


   Other changes:

 * package ezunits: TeX property for units conversion operator
 * package maximaMathML: some updates
 * package draw: support for gnuplot terminal canvas
 * documentation: updating Brazilian Portuguese translation of user manual


   Bug fixes:

 * 2703: plotting option legend causes an error
 * 2702: plotting option adapt_depth causes an error
 * 2701: plotting option logy causes an error
 * 2700: plot option psfile causes an error
 * 2699: nticks seems ignored
 * 2696: *prompt-prefix* and *prompt-suffix* not inserted for askinteger / asksign
 * 2695: kill kills built-in properties of operator after user-defined property
 * 2687: call-arguments-limit easily exhaustable in tex1
 * 2682: Function zeta fails numerically for large numbers that aren't even integers
 * 2681: solve_rec wrong result
 * 2676: integral incorrect when variable is subscripted
 * 2675: maxima will not do the simplest of definite integrals and will not factor otherwise
 * 2671: Since 4833b5 Maxima (with ECL at least) outputs palette numbers gnuplot


 unnumbered bugs:

 * bug in gnuplot_term option
 * bug in starplot
 * bug in ratinterpol
 * %e^^A should not simplify to %e^A
 * %pi is now correctly rounded with high probability
 * embedded plotting bug in XMaxima
 * bug in single-label case for plotting option 'label'
 * bug in comment indentation in Emacs
 * $CONS and friends should treat lists the same as other expressions
 * mailing list 2014-02-27: "assigning to a list of structure fields does not work"
