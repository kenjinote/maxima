This directory contains the files containing the test steps for the maxima core.
The files with the test steps for the share packages can be found in the share/
subdirectory.

All test suite files consist of blocks of the following pattern:
 - <command that is to be executed>;
 - <expected result>$

If writing new test files please try to make them end with maxima in a state
that allows it still to run other tests or to run this test again.

In order to make the new file automatically be run by the run_testsuite()
command please register eventual new test files in src/testsuite.lisp.
