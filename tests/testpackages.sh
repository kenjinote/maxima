# That script tries to find all Maxima 'packages' and load them
# - once
# - twice
# - any combination of two packages
# to find incompatibilities, not working packages, etc.

# Usage: Call
# tests/testpackages.sh
# from the Maxima source directory (the script expects a compiled 
# Maxima there (./maxima-local is called...)

# The question is - what is really a "package" and what is just a
# helper file for other packages?
# currently all Maxima ".mac" files are loaded
# (except for some testing and demo files)
#
# Yes, I know, Lisp files should also be considered.

# Some packages create a gnuplot window, so the script requires a working X Display
# (and can't (currently) be run from a cron-job).

# Do everything in English
export LANG=C
